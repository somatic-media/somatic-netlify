Backpacks 4 Vic Kids

The charity Backpacks 4 Kids was founded in April 2015 and runs solely on donations, fundraisings, grants and sponsorship. The purpose is to provide backpacks to children and families needing emergency care at their greatest time of need.



It is hard to imagine that children who are placed into emergency care can be moved without much more than what they are wearing at the time. This is where Backpacks 4 Vic Kids comes in providing backpacks or nappy bags including essential items such as toiletries, appropriate clothing, sleepwear, a torch, blanket and a toy or activity which will belong to the child and will stay with them.



The charity has provided and delivered over 3900 backpacks to families in need. Let’s help them meet their goal of putting together another 40 backpacks this Friday.



Background

Backpacks 4 Vic Kids became more than just an idea when Sally Beard (founder of Backpacks 4 Vic Kids) came across admin officer, Caroline, who had been a child placed in foster care about 15 years earlier. Caroline said she “remembered being given one of those backpacks as she sat in the back of the police car holding the backpack really tightly, because to her it represented much more than just a backpack, for her it was everything that she had in the world to call hers.”



Caroline progressed through her carers, she grew out of the clothes and went through many changes but the one consistency while everything else was a constant change was her backpack. The backpack had made a difference to the way that she felt about herself and the way she felt about her journey.



Caroline’s story proved to Sally that her idea has made a difference and will continue to make a difference.
